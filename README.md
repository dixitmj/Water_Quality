# Water Quality Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, merging datasets, time-series analysis with forecasting (ARIMA), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and modeling techniques applied to water-related datasets.

## Project Structure

- `Merging_Data.ipynb`: Notebook detailing methods for merging multiple water datasets into a cohesive dataset.
- `Preprocessing_WaterData.ipynb`: Covers essential preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
- `Report_EDA.ipynb`: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis, including visualizations, descriptive statistics, and insights.
- `Time_Series.ipynb`: Time-series analysis, forecasting using ARIMA, trend analysis, and insights into seasonality.
- `PCA.ipynb`: Principal Component Analysis implementation for Identifiying outlier and natural pattern detection.


## Installation
